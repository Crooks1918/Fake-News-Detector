## Overview 

Fake news refers to false or misleading information presented as legitimate news. It is often designed to appear credible but is ultimately created to deceive, manipulate, or generate revenue.

There are two main categories:

- Misinformation – False information shared without harmful intent.
- Disinformation – False information intentionally created and spread to deceive or cause harm.

This project develops an automated system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to classify news articles as credible or fake.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

Develop a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake

Deploy the system as a web application or API

Allow users to input a news article and receive a real/fake prediction

Demonstrate a practical, real-world application of NLP and ML

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Fake news spreads rapidly and can have significant societal consequences. This project aims to:

Help combat the spread of fake news online

Support informed decision-making

Enhance public trust in media and digital platforms

Reduce societal and political impact of misinformation

Showcase applied data science in solving real-world problems
